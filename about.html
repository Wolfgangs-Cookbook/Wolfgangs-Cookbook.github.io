      <h1>About Wolfgang's Cookbook</h1>
      <p>
        Wolfgang's Cookbook was created to offer high-flavor recipes that respect modern health needs. 
        Inspired by the FDA’s recent recommendations to reduce sodium intake, the site focuses on meals 
        that taste great while going easier on salt, sugar, and processed ingredients. Many recipes are 
        also designed to be low-carb or IBS-friendly. Whether you’re cooking to manage a condition or just 
        eat better day-to-day, the goal here is to keep cooking joyful without sacrificing wellness.

      <h2>Meet the Chef</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Wolfgang Ofstedal</strong> — I live in <strong>Miami, Florida</strong> but grew up 
        in the Midwest. Cooking has always been my creative outlet, and over time it’s also become a 
        personal path to better health. I was diagnosed with a rare kidney condition called 
        <em>FSGS</em> (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis), which means I have to be especially 
        mindful about salt in my diet. That challenge pushed me to explore new techniques and 
        cuisines that could satisfy without overloading on sodium. This site is the result of 
        that journey — a space to share what I’m learning and loving in the kitchen.
