      <h1>About Wolfgang's Cookbook</h1>
      <p>
        Wolfgang's Cookbook was created to offer high-flavor recipes that are as healthy as possible.
        Inspired by my personal sodium restriction, which seems to be a more and more common practice.
        The Average daily sodium intake in the U.S. is approximately 3,400mg/day, while the FDA 
        guidelines for adults is only 2,300mg/day. The goal of these recipes is totaste great while 
        going easier on salt, sugar, and processed ingredients. Whether you’re cooking to manage a 
        healthcondition or just want to eat better day-to-day, the goal here is to keep cooking 
        joyful without sacrificing wellness.

      <h2>Meet the Chef</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Wolfgang Ofstedal</strong> and I live in <strong>Miami, Florida</strong> but grew up 
        in the Midwest. Cooking is part of my daily routine in order to stay alive, and over time it’s 
        also become a an easy way to stay healthy and avoid the highly salty, over-sweetened, and 
        over-processed foods that are so common in restaurants and prepared foods. I was diagnosed with 
        a rare kidney condition at a young age, which means I have to be especially mindful about salt 
        in my diet. I also aspire to live forever. These goals have pushed me to explore new techniques 
        and recipes that can satisfy without sacrificing health. This site is a simple collection of  
        recipes that I've found and developed over the years.
