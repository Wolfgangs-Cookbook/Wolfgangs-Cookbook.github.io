        <h2>Low-Salt Neapolitan Dough</h2>
        <p>12–72hr Refrigerated Bulk-Ferment</p>
        <p>Note that this recipe is still being tested and will be updated on an ongoing basis.</p>
        <li>This is a bulk fermentation recipe, which is the most common method of making pizza dough, and many consider to be the easiest. Some people prefer to use a preferment dough like biga or poolish, as they claim it gives a better flavor and texture. Whichever technique you choose, you can likely achieve similar results by varying the yeast amount and fermentation time and temperature. Some people claim that increasing the cold-fermentation time of a bulk dough improves the flavor, and you will need to reduce the yeast to account for this.</li>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>500g 00 flour (or bread flour), recommended: Caputo Pizzeria 50% and Caputo Chef's 50%</li>
          <li>325g water (65%)</li>
          <li>0.35g dry active yeast</li>
          <li>4g salt</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix yeast into water. Add flour 20% at a time, mixing well after each addition. 
          <li>Once 80% of flour is added and mixed, add half of the remaining flour and salt and mix.</li>
          <li>Spread remaining 10% of flour onto counter, remove dough from bowl, and kneed it on the floured counter.</li>
          <li>Kneed well for 5 minutes and ensure all flour from counter is mixed in, or until dough is 23c or 73f.</li>
          <li>Let rest for 2 hours, folding every 60 minutes.</li>
          <li>After second set of folding (at 2hrs), divide into 3-4 dough balls, put into covered container (oiled or floured as preferred), and let rise at room temp for 2–4 hours.</li>
          <li>Cold ferment in the fridge for 12–72 hours.</li>
          <li>Let dough warm to room temp for 2-4 hours before stretching.</li>
          <li>Bake at 800-1000°F in a pizza oven for 1-2 minutes, or in an oven at the highest temperature (450-600°F) on a pizza steel or stone until bubbly and charred (5–8 minutes).</li>
          <li>If baking in a home oven, wait 30-40 minutes after preheating to let oven heat evenly before baking pizza. Try to only open oven momentarily to reduce heat loss.</li>
          <li>Let cool for 1-2 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the dough within 72 hours max.</li>
          <li>If using fresh yeast, use 3x the amount of yeast (0.35g = 1.05g fresh yeast).</li>
          <li>For a faster rise, use 0.4g dry active yeast and do not refrigerate.</li>
          <li>For more tang, extend the cold ferment to 72 hours (reduce yeast slightly).</li>
          <li>If using a home oven, recommend using a pizza steel (preferable) or stone to help with even heating.</li>
          <li>If using a home oven, try turning on the broiler on high for the last 30-90 seconds to help with charring.</li>
          <li>If preparing pizza on a pizza peel, ensure the peel is well sprinkled with semolina flour (preferable), cornmeal, or flour to prevent sticking and ensure a good launch.</li>
          <li>Ensure dough is only left on peel for 1-2 minutes before baking, as it will start to stick to the peel.</li>
          <li>Dough balls can be frozen for several months in airtight containers. Let thaw at room temperature for 5 hours or in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours.</li>
