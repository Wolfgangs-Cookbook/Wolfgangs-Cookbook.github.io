        <h2>Low-Salt Biga Neapolitan Dough</h2>
        <p>Classic 65% Hydration with an Overnight Biga Preferment</p>
        <p>Note that this recipe is unfinished and needs to be updated</p>
        <li>Biga is a traditional Italian pre-ferment made with flour, yeast, and water, that can be used in many breads.</li>
        <li>Biga is similar to Poolish, another Italian pre-ferment, but biga is made with a lower hydration and is fermented for longer.Generally, biga will be heavier and more dense than a poolish, with bulk ferment being the densest.</li>
        <li>Regardless of whether you use bulk fermentation, biga, or poolish, you will likely need to use trial and error to find the best ingredient ratios because every flour, yeast, and oven are different, and also elevation could play a factor.</li>
        <li>The below recipe is simply what I found to work well for me.</li>

        <section>
          <h3>Ingredients (3-4 12-14 inchpizzas)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>500g 00 flour or bread flour. Recommended: 50% Caputo Pizzeria, 50% Caputo Chef's</li>
          <li>325g water (65% hydration total)</li>
          <li>0.35g active dry yeast (for biga)</li>
          <li>4g salt</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Make the Biga (the day before):</strong> Mix 330g flour, 165g water (room temp), and 0.3g yeast until just combined. Leave in a covered bowl or tub at 18–20°C (64–68°F) for 12–16 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Dough:</strong> Add the remaining 170g flour, 160g water, and 4g salt to the biga. Mix until combined and knead until smooth (hand or machine). In order to get the dough to mix well, you may need to let it rest between mixes to allow the biga to absorb the water.</li>
          <li>Rest covered at room temperature for 1 hour, then perform 2–3 stretch and folds, 20 minutes apart.</li>
          <li>Transfer to the fridge for a cold bulk ferment for 24–72 hours.</li>
          <li>Remove from fridge 4–6 hours before baking. Divide into 3 dough balls (~275g), shape, and rest at room temperature until airy and pliable.</li>
          <li>Stretch gently into 10–11 inch rounds. Top and bake on a steel or stone at 500–550°F for 6–8 minutes or until puffy and charred.</li>
        </ol>

        </section>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The biga should look dry and webby when ready — resist adding more water at first.</li>
          <li>Try 48–72 hours total ferment for better flavor and digestibility.</li>
          <li>Salt is reduced in this dough to suit low-sodium diets; adjust sauce and toppings accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
