          <section>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

          <h3>For the Poolish (Make the Night Before)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>250g all-purpose or bread flour</li>
            <li>250g water (room temp)</li>
            <li>0.2g active dry yeast (a pinch — about 1/16 tsp)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>For the Final Dough</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>250g all-purpose or bread flour</li>
            <li>75g water (cold)</li>
            <li>4g salt (about 1 tsp)</li>
            <li>0.2g active dry yeast (another pinch)</li>
            <li>All of the poolish</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the poolish:</strong> Stir together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 12–16 hours until bubbly and doubled.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, add the rest of the flour, salt, yeast, and water. Add the poolish. Mix until shaggy, then knead by hand or mix in a stand mixer until smooth and elastic (5–8 min).</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk ferment:</strong> Cover and rest for 1–2 hours at room temperature, doing 1–2 stretch and folds every 30 minutes to build strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and shape:</strong> Divide into 2 or 3 equal dough balls (depending on your pizza size). Shape gently and place in oiled containers or a floured tray.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold proof:</strong> Refrigerate for 8–48 hours for best flavor. Bring to room temperature 1–2 hours before baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Stretch and bake:</strong> Stretch by hand, top as desired, and bake on a preheated stone or steel at 500°F+ until golden and bubbly (6–9 minutes).</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hydration is 65%, great for home oven use—easy to stretch but still bubbly.</li>
            <li>If short on time, increase yeast to 1g in the final dough and shorten fridge proof to 4–6 hours.</li>
            <li>Use bread flour for more chew, or a mix of AP + bread flour for balance.</li>
          </ul>
